# Challenge Summary
In this week's challenges, we were to create a linter, a weather analyzer, and tally votes. The linter was designed to identify duplicates and return true if duplicates existed and false if it didn't, based on the numbers rolled in a die. The weather analyzer was designed to return the max and min temps. Finally the tally returned the candidate with the most votes, along with the number of votes received.

## Whiteboard Process
None was created.

## Approach & Efficiency
I began this project doing research on how to roll and virtual die. I found something that helped me write a for loop that would roll the die, push the number rolled into an array list, then roll again. I repeated this process for the weather analyzer and tally. In the tally of votes, instead of using an array list, I used a hashmap. This required assistance from the TA, because I had not realized I would need both a for and while loop, to successfully record the tally.
## Solution
I have yet to get the linter to work. I have been trying for the last two days. I got some help, but they weren't able to help get passed the error. The other two app work fine.
